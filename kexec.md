### Step 1: Install kexec Tools
Most Linux distributions come with `kexec tools` available in their package repositories. 

You can install them using your distribution's package manager. 

On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you would use:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install kexec-tools
```
### Step 2: Configure kexec
After installing `kexec-tools`, you need to tell it which kernel to load and with what parameters. 

This is typically done by specifying the kernel image and the initial RAM disk (initrd) along with the default kernel command line parameters (which can be found at `/proc/cmdline`).

Find the Kernel and Initrd:
Locate the kernel image (vmlinuz) and the initial RAM disk (initrd.img) that you want to load. These are usually found in /boot. For example:

```
/boot/vmlinuz-<version>
/boot/initrd.img-<version>
```
Replace `<version>` with the specific version of the kernel you want to use.

#### Load the Kernel with kexec:

Use `kexec` to load the new kernel into memory, e.g.:

```
 sudo kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-<version> --initrd=/boot/initrd.img-<version> --append="kernel command line"
```
Replace kernel command line with the command line parameters your kernel needs. These are often the same parameters your current kernel is using, which you can find in /proc/cmdline.

### Step 3: Trigger a kexec Reboot
Once the new kernel is loaded into memory using kexec, you can trigger a reboot into the new kernel without going through the BIOS or firmware.

To do this, use the `kexec -e` command:
```
sudo kexec -e
```

You will immediately reboot the system into the new kernel that you loaded with `kexec -l` :)

### Additional Considerations
Kernel Command Line: Make sure the kernel command line parameters (`--append="..."`) are correct. 

These parameters are crucial for the kernel to boot properly.
  

#### System Compatibility
Some systems, especially those with complex hardware or specific firmware requirements, might not work correctly with kexec.

  
#### Grub Configuration
If you're using GRUB, be aware that kexec bypasses GRUB. Any changes made in GRUB configuration won't affect a kexec-based boot.
#### Testing and Safety
Since kexec immediately loads and executes a new kernel, it's a good idea to test this in a controlled environment to ensure that your system configurations are compatible.

### Shell Script for Automation
```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the version number is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <version>"
    exit 1
fi

# Assign the provided version number to a variable
VERSION="$1"

# Kernel command line - replace this with your actual kernel command line
KERNEL_CMD_LINE="root=UUID=your-uuid ro"

# Construct and execute the kexec command
sudo kexec -l /boot/vmlinuz-"$VERSION" --initrd=/boot/initrd.img-"$VERSION" --append="$KERNEL_CMD_LINE"

# Check if the kexec command was successful
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Kernel version $VERSION loaded successfully."
else
    echo "Failed to load kernel version $VERSION."
fi
```
